glimpse(gun_deaths)
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
#create subset of gun_deaths with the name youth
youth <- gun_deaths %>% 
  filter(age <= 65)
```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` gun deaths. Only 
`r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are of age <= 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

``` {r, echo = TRUE}
#***** output Plot *****
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```
